# solar-system
Gestalterworkshop @artcom let's create a solar system.

## A small example
This repository is a small example to teach and show designers the basics of Unity.
The tasks are:
* Create a scene
* Add gameObjects to it
* Understand the hierachy in the scene
* Play around, add effects to your solar-system and create so animations or camera moves.
